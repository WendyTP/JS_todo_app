This is a repositoty for a todo application created using JavaScript Object Oriented approach

Application Specifications:
- Todo:  responsible for creating the `todo` objects. (ie. constructor)
- todoList: an object that has a collection of `todo` objects.
- todoManager: responsible for returning a set of `todo`s from a `todoList` based on certain criteria.


1. `Todo`:
- create a `todo` that has unique `id`
- each todo obj has only below properties & shared methods
  properties:
  - id (unique)
  - title
  - completed  (true/ false)
  - month 
  - year 
  - description  

  shared methods:
  - isWithinMonthYear(month, year)  

- create a single `todo` with below user input: `title`, `month`, `year`, `description` 
- user input should all be in string format
  ex: 
  let todoData = {
    title: 'Buy Milk',
    month: '1',
    year: '2017',
    description: 'Milk for baby',
  };

Assumption:
  - assume Todo constuctor is available for use at global scope
  - need to validate todoData inputs
  - `completed` is default to `false`
  - title: strings containing letters, spaces, numbers. At least 3 letters (space not included)
  - description: strings containing letters, spaces, numbers. At least 3 letters (space not included); can be empty string
  - month: string of 1 - 12, can be empty string
  - year: string of 4 digits numbers, can be empty string
  - unique id: positive integer starts from 1


2. `todoList`:
- an object that contains a collection of `todo` objects
- methods on `todoList` returns only a copy of the collection or a subset of it. 
-  It does not allow users or others objects to manipulate the values of todo objects directly.
- The todoList object supports the following operations:
  - Initializes the collection with todo objects
  - Maintains a collection of `todo` objects ?
  - Adds a `todo` object to the collection
  - Deletes a `todo` object from the collection
  - Updates existing properties of a specific todo object
  - Returns a specified todo object based on its id property
- todoSet is an array of `todoData`

Assumption:
  - methods on `todoList` do not mutate the `todo` object (except update)
  - collection of `todo`s is grouped in an array
  - assume `todos` is initialised with empty array before adding todo objects
  - assume add, delete methods output logs after method call
  - assume update method output error log or return an array containing updated todo

3. `todoManager`:
- The `todoManager` interfaces with the todoList object.
- methods on `todoManager` query `todoList` to return all or subset of `todo`s as an array
- `The `todoManager` query `todoList` object :
  - Return all todo objects
  - Returns a specified todo object based on its id property
  - Return all todo objects within a given month-year combination
  - Return all completed todo objects within a given month-year combination

Assumption:
  - Assume given month and year are valid input
